## Introduction
After the second module of Ironhack Bootcamp, we learned how to make a complete Web application. Our app is about Money Management, in a simplified way.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank all our family, colleagues and teachers that helped us achieve the goal of create our first Fullstack Web Application! 

## Getting Started
This application works at the browser and does not need any installation.
