## Introduction
After the second module of Ironhack Bootcamp, we learned how to make a complete Web application. Our app is about Money Management, in a simplified way.

## Contributing
Please feel free to fork/clone this repo to look deeper into the logics of our app and contribute with some of the above improvements if you like! By forking this repo, use '$ npm install' in your terminal to add all dependencies needed. You will also need to create a ".env" file in your root folder and add some keys:
* PORT=YOUR_LOCALHOST_ACCESS_PORT
* MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME_IN_MONGODB
* ENV=DEV

## Getting Started
This application works at the browser and does not need any installation.
You can easily acesss this link to use it:  [I want to take control of my money](https://mais-dinheiro.herokuapp.com/)

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank all our family, colleagues and teachers that helped us achieve the goal of create our first Fullstack Web Application!
